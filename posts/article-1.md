This is my first blog post using a Gleam-based blogging system. I'm excited to share my thoughts on web development and programming in general.

**At least it was mean to be.**

> My goal was to use a weekend to get my website up and running. It was also my chance to get familar with [Gleam](http://gleam.run) ahead of the [Gleam meet up](https://meetdown.app/group/58acfb/Gleam-London) in London.
> I ended up building with Go + Templ + Htmx (GoTH) and deploying to [Fly fly little servers](fly.io). The journery tp the first version was no easy feat. I would make a blog post on that in the future.

## The Original Plan

The plan was to talk about Gleam and what I found exciting about it asides it amazingly cool color and branding `#ffadf3, #584355, #fffbe8, #292d3f` and the `Lucy the starfish`??? Gorgeous!.

To be honest that is what initially sold me on the language, along with the fact I was tryng out new languages including Golang as a way to not be bored out of my mind with my day job which uses Javascript.

## Why Gleam?

Gleam is a fantastic language that combines the best of functional programming with strong typing. Here are a few reasons why I love Gleam:

1. **Type Safety**: Gleam's type system helps catch errors at compile-time.
2. **Erlang Compatibility**: We can leverage the power of the BEAM ecosystem.
3. **Friendly Syntax**: Gleam's syntax is clean and easy to read.

## Code Example

Here's a simple Gleam function:

```gleam
pub fn greet(name: String) -> String {
  "Hello, " <> name <> "!"
}
```

## What now?

Well, for now I will keep building with the `GoTh`🧛🏾‍♂️🧛🏾‍♂️ stack and improving the blog as a whole. I have chosen another path to learn more about Gleam and would appreciate if you checked it out. I am making an Rss/Json/Atom feed package in Gleam.

I will share my experience as I build. Welcome to Ji's Blog.
